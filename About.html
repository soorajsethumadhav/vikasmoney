healthy system where people exchanged services and goods for other services and goods in return, A beautiful system where money is not involved. For a moment he wished  Barter system should have prevailed…. and cursed the current monetary system. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the years passed by the Barter system gave way to a new monetary system involving currency with this paradigm shift money gained power and started ruling the human, society and eventually the nation , dividing them in to developed, developing and under developed nations.

                        Money differentiates the society in to rich and poor.
                        The current socio economic situation made the rich, richer and the poor poorer , which paved
                        the way for social insecurity and unrest. The recent
                        socio economic changes and the changing fiscal policies of the government made 
                        banking industry really challenging..
                
            
                    <p>
                        With heart and Soul I took up that challenge and ventured in
                        to “BANKING INDUSTRY”
                        The outcry and helplessness of the needy …Fell on deaf

A true revelation. After graduation my career was at crossroads…which profession to pursue…? Either be an entrepreneur or be a decently salaried employee in any MNCs…

                        Since the call of the needy has been haunting .I ventured in to money lending business and started Sreekrishna Enterprises in 1997 at my village cherpullessery in a humble way, with the trust and integrity I gained among my customers ,the business graph slowly ascended .I realize the needs and requirements of the artisans and small traders and stood by them and shouldered them to achieve success .I grew strong with my customers and that confidence motivated me to go the next level and entered the chit fund business in 1999 by starting Aeppeeyem chits & kuries followed by sreekrishna bankers in 2001.Providing gold loan was the main line of activity at SKB. Acquisition of VIKAS HIRE PURCHASE Co. Ltd  in 2012, an NBFC was really turning point as the demand for Two wheeler loan was catching up momentum at that time. In 2015 , VIKAS became an ISO 2008-2015 Company he also started the nidhi copany , MANDHIR VIKAS NIDHI Ltd, In 2017 he is successfully getting F.F.M.C license from RESERVE BANK OF INDIA and started a separate division of VIKAS FORIGN EXCHANGE to take care of the foreign exchange related 
activities including fund transfer .During the same period he stated the service of issuing air tickets .He was also successful in getting permission for issue of debentures in 2017.

                        The proven track record in money lending and the trust , I developed among my glorified customers made me the undoubted market leader in NBFC and VIKAS MONEY LTD in Palaghat district .Let me take this opportunity to thank wholeheartedly all my customers who stood by me in thick & thin and partnered in my success as a much sought after banker
