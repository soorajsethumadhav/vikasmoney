                            Since the call of the needy has been haunting I ventured in to money lending business and started Sreekrishna Enterprises in 1997 at my village cherpullessery in a humble way, with the trust and integrity I gained among my customers and that confidence motivated me to go next level and entered the chit fund business in 1999 by starting Aeppeeyem chits & kuries followed by sreekrishna bankers in 2001-Providing gold loan was the main line of activity.
